    <h1> Where are we going with this?</h1>

<p>

    Pathsy is a way to give your career journey some context.
</br> </br>
    Career and job discovery as it currently exists is dominated by companies that
     create spaces for people to connect, but they containerize the job experience.
     There is no way to visualize how one person's journey may connect to another's.
     In doing so, one must parse through a significant chunk of data before understanding trends,
      hearing stories or finding alternative career paths.
</br></br>
    Fundamentally, the problem Pathsy solves is de-containerizing your career and
    allowing people to see their path in the context of others. It creates a visual
     pathway to explore trends in people's career paths and build a timeline for your own career journey.
